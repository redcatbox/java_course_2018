I was riding, I was riding
The sun was rising up from the fields
I got a feeling I just can’t shake
I got a feeling that just won’t go away
You’ve gotta just keep on pushing
Push the sky away

And if your friends think that you should do it different
And if they think that you should do it the same
You’ve gotta just keep on pushing
Push the sky away

And if you feel you got everything you came for
If you got everything and you don’t want no more
You’ve gotta just keep on pushing
Push the sky away

And some people say it’s just rock and roll
Oh but it gets you right down to your soul
You’ve gotta just keep on pushing
Push the sky away
